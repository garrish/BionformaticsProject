Construction of Phylogenetic Trees by UPGMA Clustering of DNA Sequences

Introduction

This Python script performs UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) hierarchical clustering on DNA sequences stored in a FASTA file. UPGMA clustering is a widely used method in bioinformatics to construct dendrograms, particularly in molecular phylogenetics, to visualize the evolutionary relationships between sequences.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
 
	•	NumPy
 
	•	Biopython
 
	•	SciPy
 
	•	Matplotlib
 
Usage

		Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
		Ensure that the required Python libraries (NumPy, Biopython, SciPy, and Matplotlib) are installed.
		Place your FASTA file containing DNA sequences in the same directory as the script.
		Modify the file_name variable in the script to specify the name of your FASTA file.
		Run the script using a Python interpreter.
		The script will generate a dendrogram visualization of the UPGMA clustering of the DNA sequences.
